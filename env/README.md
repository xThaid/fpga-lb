# Environment
This directory contains the Dockerfile and scripts required to build the whole environment for working with the project. Simply run `make build` to build the Docker image. It will roughly take ~30 minutes and a lot of your disk space (about 30 GB).

**Note**: the shell scripts aren't meant to be run on the host system. It can mess up your system configuration.
